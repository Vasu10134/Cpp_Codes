Here i am posting my daily progress...✌️

C++ relies on functionalities to access various functionality, to perform basic operations like input and output, we use cin & cout operation.
ex. int x;
cin>>x;
cout<<x;

These operations included in #include<iostream> library.
We can use #include<bits/stdc++.h> library that includes majority of c++ libraries collection.

We use endl; to terminate line in a code.
ex. cout<<"Let's Code"<<endl;

We use using namespace std; at the beginning of the programme so that we don't have to explicitly specifying std:: each time we use input, output, or line termination operation.



Data are stored in some container commonly known as Datatypes .

integer: 4 bytes
short int : 2 bytes
long int : 8 bytes

float : 4 bytes
double : 8 bytes

char : 1 byte

We can store multiple words in a string by using getline function as :
getline(cin, string_name);




Conditional statements are allows you to make decisions when certain conditions are met, when the desired conditions are met, you can execute your block of code.

if-else statements : 
if block is executed when the condition inside it is true, otherwise else block of code executes. 

if-else ladder statements : 
In if-else-ladder, we use ladder of else-if statements, when we have multiple conditions to check.



There are two types of complexity :
Time Complexity
Space Complexity
